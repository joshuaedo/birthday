# Is Today Joshua Edo's Birthday?

This website is available only once a year on my birthday. It serves as a dedicated space to mark the occasion and share the day with visitors.

## About

I'm Joshua Edo, a web developer focused on creating functional and visually engaging digital experiences. This birthday website is a simple project to celebrate a personal milestone, while showcasing some of the web development tools I regularly work with.

## Technologies Used

The website uses the following technologies:

1. **React**: Manages the website's dynamic and interactive features.
2. **Vite**: A fast build tool that streamlines development and improves performance.
3. **Framer Motion**: Adds animations and transitions for a more fluid user experience.
4. **GSAP**: A JavaScript animation library used to create visual effects.
5. ~~**Locomotive Scroll & Lenis**: Removed for a simpler navigation experience.~~

## Project Structure

- **`/public`**: Includes static assets such as images and the `index.html` file.
- **`/src/components`**: Reusable components built with React.
- **`/src/styles`**: Contains CSS and styling-related files.
- **`/src/lib/anim`**: Configuration for animations using Framer Motion and GSAP.
